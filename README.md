The frontend was developed using the Next.js framework as it enables server‑side rendering, optimized performance, and efficient integration of dynamic AI‑driven content.

It heavily utilizes the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component library, allowing rapid interface development and maintaining consistent design efficiency even with a single developer on the FE side.
